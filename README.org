* Steam Deck Screenshot Aggregator
** What?
   A very simple and dumb tool for copying ALL screenshots that you have on your Steam Deck. Reasons it's dumb:
   - It will combine screenshots from the same game from multiple users
   - It makes symlinks (for now) and will not remove dead symlinks
   - It pulls the entire steam app list on every run
   - It cannot figure out the name of non-steam apps that screenshots may belong to (I could use some help with this one)
** Why?
   Steam's screenshot uploading system sucks.
** How to use this?
   It's a basic python script. You can clone the repo and just run the script over ssh. You can also add it as a nonsteam game. If I can figure out how, I'll supply a script for this at some point.
   
   When you run it, it will create a folder at =~/Pictures/Screenshots= and will create folders for each game and symlink all the screenshots there. From there
   
   In the future I may also integrate this with Crankshaft or DeckyLoader.
